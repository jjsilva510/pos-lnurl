          BuzzPay (LNURL) is a simple PoS powered by LNURL. It has only limited access to your
          wallet: It can receive payments but not send them. Once you've connected your wallet can
          easily share your PoS link with your co-workers.
        </p>
        <p>BuzzPay also works great as a PWA. Try it out by saving it to your homescreen!</p>
        <p>After connecting to your wallet, bookmark the page to make sure you don't lose it.</p>
